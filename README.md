# CovidCorrelations
Correlations in pandemic world are calculated between Covid-19 and ABO groups. The initial results from this code are shown in SSRN: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3794044.

The code was implemented in R and the main  file is TemporalAnalysis.R.

The results are saved in the directory: Results(date of analysis)/ .  

Since version v0.0 has automatic data file downloaded from  Our World in Data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/raw/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv .

Refactoring and others advances has been done. R programming was used in a structured language manner. Better practices of R programming language maybe implemented in the future.

Current results (2022) have been prepared to new version of the SSRN article above.

The PCA analysis have been in progress, but the prelimary results were consistent with correlations.
