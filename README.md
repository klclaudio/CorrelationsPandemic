# CovidCorrelations
Correlations in pandemic world are calculated for Covid-19 and ABO groups.
The initial results from this code are shown in SSRN: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3794044.

The code was implemented in R and the main  file is TemporalAnalysis.R.

The results are saved in the directory: Results(date of analysis)/ .  

The first version v(0.0) has automatic data file downloaded from  Our World in Data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/raw/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv .

Refactoring and others advances  has been in progress. R programming was used in a structured language manner, like a tool to solve the problem. Better practices of R programming language may be implemented in the future.

Current results  (2022) has been prepared to new version of the SSRN article above.

The PCA analysis is incomplete, but the prelimary results were consistents with correlations.
