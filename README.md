# CovidCorrelations

Correlations in pandemic world are calculated between Covid-19 deaths and ABO groups. The initial results from this code are shown in SSRN: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3794044.

The code was implemented in R, the main file are TemporalAnalysis_owd.R and TemporalAnalysis_owd_log.R.

Configure file conf-options.R before run.

The results are saved in the directory: Results-cumulative-(date of analysis>) .

Since version v0.0 has automatic data file downloaded from  Our World in Data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/raw/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv , in this current version there is an option to use saved data.

Refactoring and others advances have been done. R programming was used in a structured language manner.

Current results (2024) have been prepared to new version of the SSRN article above.

Future work: studies of derivatives from temporal evolution of the coefficients.
